= How to Use =

Once you have installed and activated this plugin, add or edit a venue. Under the Venue Information panel, a new panel called Social Media Profiles will appear. Choose your display settings and add each profile here. Look for the "Add new profile" link at the bottom of that panel to add more.

This plugin uses the font icons from [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/ "Icon font for the web") to display social media icons. The selection of available networks is based on the icons available in this pack.

However, this plugin provides filters so you can easily customize and extend it for your particular needs. These filters allow you to:

* Customize which social networks can be selected and the HTML output for each network
* Add or remove CSS stylesheets that are loaded on the front-end
* Customize the default metadata and settings.

This plugin is on GitHub, so fork it up.
