Add social media profiles to venues in Events Calendar Pro. This plugin requires the Events Calendar Pro plugin by Modern Tribe.

== Description ==

**This plugin requires the [Events Calendar Pro](http://tri.be/shop/wordpress-events-calendar-pro/ "Purchase Events Calendar Pro") plugin by Modern Tribe.**

Add social media profiles to venues in Events Calendar Pro. Add links to a venue's profiles on Facebook, Twitter and more. These profiles will automatically be displayed on the venue's page.

This plugin adds a new meta box to the venue editing page, which allows you to add and edit social media profiles. By default, it supports the following social networks:

* Facebook
* Twitter
* Google+
* Youtube
* Flickr
* Pinterest
* Foursquare
* Instagram
* LinkedIn
* Vimeo
* Skype
* Yelp
* MySpace
* SoundCloud
* Lanyrd

Please note that this plugin **will not work** with the free version of [Events Calendar](http://wordpress.org/plugins/the-events-calendar/ "View Events Calendar on the WordPress plugin repository"). It requires the ability to have saved venues, which is only available in the [pro version ](http://tri.be/shop/wordpress-events-calendar-pro/ "Purchase Events Calendar Pro") of the plugin.

= How to Use =

Once you have installed and activated this plugin, go to the page where you can add or edit a venue. Under the Venue Information panel, a new panel called Social Media Profiles will appear. Choose your display settings and add each profile here. Look for the "Add new profile" link at the bottom of that panel to add more.

= Developers =

This plugin uses the [Socicon](http://socicon.com/ "Socicon - an icon font for social networks") font to display the icons. It supports many more social networks than I've included here, so if you're missing one let me know. It can be added easily if the Socicon font supports it.

However, this plugin provides filters so you can easily customize and extend it for your particular needs. These filters allow you to:

* Customize which social networks can be selected and the HTML output for each network
* Add or remove CSS stylesheets that are loaded on the front-end
* Customize the default metadata and settings
* Attach the output to any template action hook

Read the FAQ page for a few tips and [get in touch](http://themeofthecrop.com/support/?utm_source=Plugin&utm_medium=Plugin%20Description&utm_campaign=Social%20Venues%20for%20Events%20Calendar "Support at Theme of the Crop") if you have any questions.

This plugin is [on GitHub](https://github.com/NateWr/social-venues-events-calendar-pro "Social Venues for Events Calendar Pro on GitHub"), so fork it up.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip `social-venues-events-calendar.zip`
2. Upload the contents of `social-venues-events-calendar.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
4. Browse to the Events > Venues page in the admin dashboard to add or edit a venue
5. Find the Social Media Profiles input panel below the Venue Information panel

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I change where the icons appear on my venue pages? =

Yes. The plugin automatically appends them to the end of the venue's description. If no description exists, it will append them to the title. However, you can attach them to any custom action hook with the following code:

`/**
 * This function attaches social media icons after 
 * the venue meta data (address, phone, etc), using
 * a custom action hook that is part of the default
 * templates provided by Events Calendar Pro.
 */
function my_custom_profiles_hook( $custom_action ) {
	$custom_action = 'tribe_events_single_venue_after_the_meta';
}
add_filter( 'svecp_custom_action', 'my_custom_profiles_hook');`

= Can I add another social network or use different icons? =

Yes! This plugin has hooks that will allow you to customize the services registered with this plugin. You'll need a little familiarity with PHP code and your theme's functions.php file.

Adding the following code to your theme's functions.php file would change the output of the Facebook icon to an image in your theme's directory:

`/**
 * Use an image icon for the Facebook profile
 */
function my_modify_network_function( $services ) {

	$services['facebook']['html'] = '<img src="' . get_stylesheet_directory_uri() . '/img/icons/facebook.png">';

	return $services;

}
add_filter( 'svecp_services', 'my_modify_network_function' );`

Of course, you'll need to have an image in your theme's directory, at `/img/icons/facebook.png', for this to display properly.

Adding another social network is just as easy:

`/**
 * Add a new network to choose from when editing a venue
 */
function my_new_network_function( $services ) {

    $services['new_network'] = array(
		'label'				=> __( 'My New Network', SVECP_TEXTDOMAIN ),
		'html'				=> '<img src="/path/to/icon/image.png">'
	);

    return $services;

}
add_filter( 'svecp_services', 'my_new_network_function' );`

If you don't want to use the Socicon font for icons, you can prevent the stylesheet from being loaded with the following code:

`/**
 * Prevent FontAwesome stylesheet from loading
 */
function my_custom_stylesheets_function( $stylesheets ) {

	$new_stylesheets = array();
	foreach( $stylesheets as $stylesheet ) {
		if ( $stylesheet['handle'] != 'svecp-styles' ) {
			$new_stylesheets[] = $stylesheet;
		}
	}

	return $new_stylesheets;

}
add_filter( 'svecp_enqueue_stylesheets', 'my_custom_stylesheets_function' );`

I'll be describing how to use this and other filters to customize this plugin more extensively in future blog posts.

= I want more features =

What do you want? I think this plugin works best if it's kept nice and simple, but if you've got other needs for your venues [let me know](http://themeofthecrop.com/support/?utm_source=Plugin&utm_medium=Plugin%20Description&utm_campaign=Social%20Venues%20for%20Events%20Calendar "Contact Theme of the Crop"). Maybe I can help.
